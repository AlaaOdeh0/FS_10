    <h1>Alaa Odeh</h1>
    <p> Hi, I'm Alaa Odeh, a Palestinian girl, 20 years old, and I study computer science apprenticeship 'AI focus' At An-Najah National University.

        I am passionate about programs and creating websites, so I registered with the Knowledge Academy to gain greater knowledge and experience that would enable me to get a job after completing the course. I am excited to explore how I can contribute to creating a project that increases my experience in this field.</p>
